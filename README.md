# CMake Skeleton

This serves as an example of how to set up CMake with Boost and Catch.

Project structure:

- The main executable is `main.cpp`
- Headers go in `inc`
- Source files go in `src`
- Tests go in `test`

To build and run the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
bin/run_tests # Run tets
bin/aldente # Run the executable
```
